<h1> Dogs </h1>
<p> I own 2 dogs a Labrador Retriever and a mixed pitbull. </p>

<h4> Dogs can be hard to train and taka care of </h4>
<p> this is why we have people we xcan pay to train our dogs. </p>

<h4> If I can have another dog what breed would it be? </h4>
<p> I would want a rottweiler </p>

<h4> Both of my dogs are big </h4>
<p> They both weigh over 70 pounds the labrador retriever weighs 102 pounds. </p>

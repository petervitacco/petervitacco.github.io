<h1> The Dogs That I Own. </h1>
<p> I own 2 dogs a Labrador Retriever and a mixed pitbull. </p>

<h4> Dogs can be hard to train and taka care of </h4>
<p> this is why we have people we can pay to train our dogs. </p>

<h4> If I can have another dog what breed would it be? </h4>
<p> I would want a rottweiler! </p>
